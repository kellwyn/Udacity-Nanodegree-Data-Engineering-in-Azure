PROJECT:
BUILDING AN AZURE DATA WAREHOUE FOR BIKE SHARE DATA ANALYTICS

Divvy is a bike sharing program in Chicago, Illinois USA that allows riders to purchase a pass at a kiosk or use a mobile application to unlock a bike at stations 
around the city and use the bike for a specified amount of time. The bikes can be returned to the same station or to another station. The City of Chicago makes 
the anonymized bike trip data publicly available for projects like this where we can analyze the data.

Goals:
	Design a star schema based on the business outcomes listed below;
	Import the data into Synapse;
	Transform the data into the star schema;
	and finally, view the reports from Analytics

Business Outcomes:
	Analyze how much time is spent per ride
			Based on date and time factors such as day of week and time of day
			Based on which station is the starting and / or ending station
			Based on age of the rider at time of the ride
			Based on whether the rider is a member or a casual rider

	Analyze how much money is spent
			Per month, quarter, year
			Per member, based on the age of the rider at account start
		
	EXTRA CREDIT - Analyze how much money is spent per member
			Based on how many rides the rider averages per month
			Based on how many minutes the rider spends on a bike per month

DELIVERABLES:
	PDF of star schema
	Screenshot - Proof of Extract - 4 Datasets copied in
	Screenshot, text files - Proof of Load - 4 external table creation scripts
	SQL Code - Proof of Transformation - Create tables in star schema
